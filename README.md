MusicBrainz Database for SQLite

MusicBrainz provided for daily dumps of the complete database and additionally provides users with the SQL code to create its database schema. Unfortunately this is written in PostgreSQL.

SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library which is not a clientâ€“server database engine (unlike MySQL or PostgreSQL). It is cross-platform and in the public domain.

But it speaks a different SQL dialect than PostgreSQL so it needs a different SQL code repository.
